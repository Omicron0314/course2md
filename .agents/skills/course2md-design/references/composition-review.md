# Composition before component checks

The 2026-09-09 preview was rejected despite extensive screenshots and passing code checks. The failure was judging whether existing content fitted, rather than whether that content and interaction belonged on the page. Use the following decision order to challenge an implementation, including this skill's own local rules.

## Start with the job

For each page, state what a person came to do, what they must recognize, and what decision remains. Remove routine internal facts that do not help them act. Successful processing belongs behind a readable result. Failed optional processing belongs beside the still-usable result, with scoped recovery. An ordinary task card needs identifiable content and a result action before it needs execution details.

Group by object or decision: a preference with its effect; a model with its state, location and preparation; a service with its model, test and edit actions; a note with its cover, identity and reading action. Long repository names are resource names, not form labels. Logs are diagnostic tools, not task content. Folding something does not by itself justify including it.

## Then establish boundaries

One complete unit owns its label, value, help and related commands. First bound that unit, then align its children. Compare actual text starts, row centers and action groups across peer units. A switch remains a switch; it need not be enlarged to match a button. Its row and explanatory region must still have a common owner.

Wide space should help reading or comparison. It must not strand a switch in the middle while its help spans a different width, separate an edit action from its current value, or inflate a successful status table over the content. At narrow widths, reflow the object rather than interleaving fragments from neighboring objects.

## Review with a chance to reject

Reviewers first inspect complete native pages without a list of claimed fixes. Ask for the most confusing or misplaced parts, including information that should be removed. Review normal, populated states with actual-length names and paths before exceptional stress cases. A loaded model, configured service, finished task, long note and opened details are normal product states.

After composition, inspect geometry and states. Exercise search in its actual scope, a recoverable failure, return from temporary settings, and a useful completed result. Cross-review another implementer's region. Preserve original observations; record changes and unresolved findings separately. Test counts, capture counts and “no more findings” cannot substitute for the main agent's judgment.

## Authoritative basis and project adaptation

Relevant official Apple HIG pages were checked against Apple's published documentation data on 2026-09-09, not merely their JavaScript HTML shells:

- [Layout](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/layout): group related content, reserve space for essential information, and make alignment communicate hierarchy. Project adaptation: complete setting/resource boundaries and less prominent routine status.
- [Settings](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/settings): choose useful defaults, avoid asking for detectable information, and keep task-specific options in context. Project adaptation: preserve the user's requested in-app settings and four-part skippable setup; no switch to a new navigation architecture merely to imitate a screenshot.
- [Entering data](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/entering-data): offer sensible prefilled values or choices, support pasting, and give field feedback. Project adaptation: service connection, model discovery and testing stay in one editor, with a separate save action.
- [Search fields](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/search-fields): make search scope clear and update useful results while typing. Project adaptation: visible note/gallery search operates on the current view, without silently navigating elsewhere.

These are brief paraphrases, not a mirror of Apple's documentation. Material sources remain in [the source guide](material-sources.md). The project's dimensions, palette selections, capsule controls and surface choices are adaptations; they do not acquire authority from being written in a skill.
