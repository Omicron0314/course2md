# Package channels and release automation

[GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/mizorewww/course2md/wiki)

| Channel | GUI | CLI |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Homebrew tap `mizorewww/tap` | Cask `course2md-gui` (Apple Silicon, macOS 15+) | Formula `course2md` |
| AUR | `course2md-gui-bin` (x86_64) | `course2md-bin` (x86_64, aarch64) |

GUI packages contain a matching private CLI engine. They do not install a terminal `course2md` command and can coexist with the standalone CLI package. Both channels install ffmpeg and yt-dlp. Model downloads and optional recognition backends are configured on first use; they are not bundled into the package.

## Automatic publication

1. The `release` workflow builds the CLI and native GUI packages and publishes a stable GitHub Release.
2. `brew-tap` and `aur` run on successful completion through `workflow_run`. This also works when the release was started manually on `main`; `packaging/release-version.py` resolves the published release for that commit.
3. Homebrew updates both `Formula/course2md.rb` and `Casks/course2md-gui.rb` in `mizorewww/homebrew-tap`, including release checksums.
4. AUR renders both PKGBUILDs and `.SRCINFO` files. It builds the GUI package on Arch, validates the desktop entry, runs the bundled CLI version check and checks for missing shared libraries before pushing either recipe.

Recipes are sourced from `packaging/aur/` and `packaging/homebrew/`. Change these templates, not only the external package repositories; future releases render them again. No release binaries are rebuilt by these synchronization jobs.

Previously, both synchronization workflows updated only CLI packages. The GUI Cask remained at 1.5.0; GUI AUR packaging was absent. The 1.7.0 CLI AUR update did succeed. This change adds both GUI channels and backfills the current release.

## Manual retry and validation

In GitHub Actions, run `brew-tap` or `aur` with `version: 1.7.0` (or the intended stable release). The AUR workflow supports `dry_run: true` to build and validate without pushing. Normal manual runs publish both packages. Jobs serialize per channel to avoid concurrent pushes.

The workflows use the existing `AUR_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` secret: the AUR job authenticates to AUR, while the Homebrew job uses the existing GitHub-authorized key configuration. `GITHUB_TOKEN` reads release metadata. Credentials are never written to package recipes.

On Arch, with the runtime dependencies and `base-devel`, `git`, `curl`, `desktop-file-utils` installed, run as a non-root user:

```sh
packaging/aur/update-aur.sh 1.7.0 --dry-run
```

The GUI package installs its application and engine under `/usr/lib/course2md-desktop/`, an application launcher in `/usr/bin/course2md-desktop`, a desktop entry and a 512×512 icon. It does not own `/usr/bin/course2md`.

## Documentation

User documentation is maintained in the [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/mizorewww/course2md/wiki). Edit pages there or clone the separate wiki repository:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:mizorewww/course2md.wiki.git
```

Keep the Chinese and English guides and the wiki sidebar aligned. README links must point to published Wiki pages. The main repository keeps development records under `docs/`; it does not keep a second copy of the user guides.
